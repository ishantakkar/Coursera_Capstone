We will try to learn using historical car accidents and how aspects like weather, road conditions, traffic and many other factors affect the probability of an accident and how severe it is."

The target column is labelled Severity with numerical values. There are 37 other columns which we can potentially use to train the algorithm. There are many columns with non-standardized data and missing values hence the data needs to be cleaned up."
